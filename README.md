# 🚢 Titanic Data Analysis Project

## 📜 Description
This Jupyter notebook is a deep dive into the Titanic dataset. The analysis aims to extract patterns and understand the demographics and survival rates of passengers.

## 🎯 Objective
The goal is to employ data manipulation and analysis techniques to reveal insights about the passengers, such as survival likelihood correlated to attributes like gender and class.

## 🛠 Tools and Technologies
- Python: For programming the analysis logic.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: For running the analysis in an interactive environment.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Titanic.csv`: Original dataset containing details of the Titanic's passengers.
- `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook with the analysis process and code.
- `titanic_result.csv`: The resulting dataset after applying filters and sorting.

## ⚙️ Analysis Process
1. Data Extraction: Select relevant columns from the dataset.
2. Filter Application: Filter the data to include only female passengers in first class who survived.
3. Sorting: Sort the filtered dataset by name in ascending order.
4. Exporting Data: Save the final filtered and sorted dataset to a CSV file.

## 📈 Expected Results
The final output is a CSV file with filtered data, providing a clear view of the selected subset of passengers.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Execute the cells in sequence to perform the analysis.
3. The `titanic_result.csv` file will be generated in the working directory.
